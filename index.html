                <p class="top-slide-target">
                    Strapi CMS served as the backbone of the content management system for Discover Lincoln, managing user-generated content for events, businesses, and attractions. It efficiently structured and scaled content, leveraging relationships between content types to ensure smooth approvals and updates.
               </p>
                <h3 class="top-slide-target">Content Management and Data Structures</h3>
                <p class="top-slide-target">
                    Strapi managed various content types, including events, businesses, attractions, and about page information. Each content type was structured with flexible data models featuring fields like titles, dates, locations, descriptions, and media, keeping content organized and easy to manage. Relationships between content types—such as linking businesses to events—enhanced navigation and created dynamic content flows.

                <h3 class="top-slide-target">Content Creation, Approval, and Relationships</h3>
                <p class="top-slide-target">
                    Strapi’s relational data structure allowed content types to interconnect, creating a seamless user experience. For example, an event could be linked to a specific business or attraction, enriching content discovery and encouraging users to explore Lincoln’s offerings more deeply through related content.
                    <br></br>
                    The approval workflow enabled admins to control what appeared on the site. Community-submitted content, such as events and businesses, was reviewed and approved through Strapi, maintaining quality and keeping the platform user-driven.                    
                </p>
                <h3 class="top-slide-target">Customization and Flexibility</h3>
                <p class="top-slide-target">
                    Strapi's <b>Content-Type Builder</b> allowed the addition of custom fields tailored to specific project needs, such as accessibility tags for businesses and events, ensuring inclusivity. This level of customization made the platform adaptable for future requirements without heavy redevelopment.

                <h3 class="top-slide-target">Media Management</h3>
                <p class="top-slide-target">
                    Strapi’s <b>Media Library</b> managed all images and media files for events, attractions, and businesses. This centralized system made uploading, managing, and reusing visuals across the site simple, ensuring consistent presentation. Each image was linked to its relevant content type, such as About Page Info or Attractions, streamlining content management.

                        and back-end functionality to create an engaging platform for showcasing 
                        the Town of Lincoln. Using tools like Next.js, Leaflet.js, and Strapi CMS,
                        the website provides dynamic content management, real-time updates, and 
                        smooth user navigation. The back-end, managed through Strapi, supports 
                        user authentication, content submission, and approval workflows, making 
                        the platform adaptable and scalable.
                     <br></br>
                        Extensive testing ensured that the site is fully responsive across both 
                        desktop and mobile. A comprehensive design process from wireframes to 
                        high-fidelity prototypes guided the development of features like the 
                        interactive map, content filtering, and user dashboards. The back-end 
                        setup also facilitated secure data management and content workflows.
                    <br></br>
                        This project highlights skills in front-end and back-end development, 
                        UI/UX design, content management, and testing, demonstrating the ability
                        to build a flexible and scalable platform that can handle future updates 
                        and content growth.
